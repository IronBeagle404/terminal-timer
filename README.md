# Terminal Timer

This is a very simple Go program that runs a timer in a terminal.

I mainly did this as some sort of basic exercise, to see how long it would take me to build something more or less functionning. 

### I plan to add the following things :
- an ASCII drawing of the timer

### Requirements
I don't think there are any actual requirements to this but let me know if you find some.
